# LedgerX Python Client

FYI - I don't have access to the trading API at the moment (it's only available to institutional accounts). LedgerX will be allowing retail in the future, at which point I plan to build out all API endpoints. In the meantime, if you're an instution and want to use this, get in touch with me and I'd be happy to build it out.

## dev env
Currently managed via miniconda. To create the env and install deps, 
1. `make env.create`
2. `make env.update`
